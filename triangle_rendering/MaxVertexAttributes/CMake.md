- `target_link_libraries(OpenGL_Project glad GL dl)`: This command links the OpenGL_Project executable with the glad, GL, and dl libraries. This means:

    - **glad**: Links the glad library you created earlier. This allows OpenGL_Project to use the functions defined in glad.c.

    - **GL**: Typically refers to the OpenGL library. On Unix-like systems, this is often libGL.so or libGL.a, which provides the OpenGL API.

    - **dl**: This is the dynamic linking library (libdl.so). It provides functions like dlopen, dlsym, and dlclose used for runtime dynamic linking.
