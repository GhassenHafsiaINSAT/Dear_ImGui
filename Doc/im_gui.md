## ImGui

- ImGui short for Immediate Mode Gui is a popular C++ library for creating graphical user interfaces in applications

- The project is an open-source project, licensed under MIT.  
- Unlike traditional GUI libraries that rely one event-driven programming (like QT or GTK), imGui uses an immediate mode paradigm, this means that GUI is redrawn every frame
- The library is lightweight and designed to be easily integrated into existing codebases
- ImGui is platform-agnostic and can work on any graphic API, such as OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, etc
- ImGui doesn't depend on any external GUI framework, simple to integrate
- ImGui operates by having you describe the interface directly in rendering loop, easy to create and modify interfaces dynamically
